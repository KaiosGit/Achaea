# Consolidated Monks Combos (Modified) for Nexus

CONSOLIDATED MONK COMBOS (Modified) version 1.2<br>
Original package created by Keorin<br>
Modifications made by Kaios<br>

In order to download this package, you may click the package itself and then on the next page right click on 'Raw' and 'Save Link as' <br>OR<br> Click the green **Code** button and download the ZIP file.

**All attacks are for Tekura monk only. This package does not have anything in place for Shikudo.**

The basic idea is that the keys used in the alias roughly correspond to the shape of a person on the keyboard:
```
          [7][8][9]                              [rndhouse][head ][jump kick]
          [4][5][6]        corresponds to        [left arm][torso][right arm]  
          [1][2][3]                              [left leg][sweep][right leg]
          [ 0 ]                                  [clear queue]
```
The combo aliases themselves will account for being in Blackout, and not attack should you attempt to while it is afflicted. They will also account for being afflicted with Aeon and use the attacks with less commands accordingly.

List of Commands
----------------
MONKSET : Displays the current settings.

MONKPK : Enables or Disables the Punch or Kick alias, depending on which one happens to be enabled at the time.

MONKCOMBOS : Use this alias to make changes to the numkey tables without the need to restart your session but remember to replace those changes in the onLoad as well.


To-do List
----------
- Need to account for Retardation vibes similar to how Aeon is being accounted for.
