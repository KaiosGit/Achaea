In order to download this package, you may click the package itself and then on the next page right click on 'Raw' and 'Save Link as' <br>OR<br> Click the green **Code** button and download the ZIP file.

The basic idea is that the keys used in the alias roughly correspond to the shape of a person on the keyboard:
```
          [7][8][9]                              [jumpkick][head ][ axekick ]
          [4][5][6]        corresponds to        [left arm][torso][right arm]  
          [1][2][3]                              [left leg][sweep][right leg]
          [ 0 ]                                  [clear queue]
```

List of Commands
----------------
