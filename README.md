Created by Kaios


REQUIREMENTS - PLEASE READ
--------------------------
**NECESSARY:** In order for this package to work, it is REQUIRED that you also have Zahan's MapDB (Map Database) reflex package as well. You can obtain this package from https://github.com/AchaeaZahan/Nexus (instructions for download are provided by his ReadMe on this page).

**OPTIONAL:** If you wish to use the Mine Collection feature, you will also need to have Voka's CharacterDB (Character Database) reflex package. This is necessary in order to get a mine owner's city with their name while prospecting. You can obtain this package from https://forums.achaea.com/discussion/6527/character-db-nexus (right click the link in the post and 'Save Link as').

To-do List
----------
- (PARTIALLY RESOLVED) Complete blocked by wall trigger. (Need method to discern the user's capabilities, eg. can they leap? are they mounted?)
- (PARTIALLY RESOLVED) Complete allowance for Wings Mode; Ensure there are no issues with movement and destination tracking, set room orders specific for Wings Mode.
- Different types of wings to account for?
- Devise method to handle room order customization (beyond manual user modification).
- Account for wendigos in Tundra. At present, their knock-down occasionally interferes with prospecting which must then be re-initialized using MAPR.<br/>
âœ“  (RESOLVED): Vision loss (such as caused by blizzards) interferes with proper GMCP identification of items (eg. reading signs, identify walls).<br/>
- Travel method from main land to Tundra? Fissure of Echoes?
- Option to send Mine/Lode collection to a text file. Save to the same file each time? Create multiple files? If pushing to same, also need date/time (in-game and real) to separate. If pushing to multiple, need date/time as file name.
- Automate lode reporting.
- Alter search alias to not return partial matches.
- Need method to avoid pushing duplicate strings to mine collection and lode collection arrays.


Credits
-------
A very special thank you to **FangFang** not only in relation to this package, but also for his constant assistance and support that he has generously given to myself and many others with Nexus scripting.

**Khaseem**, for his very helpful assistance in devising a better queueing method and for the use of his Walkto package's search alias.

**Zahan**, for without his MapDB package it would be far more difficult to create such packages like this in the first place.

**Voka**, for the creation of the CharacterDB package which is an incredibly useful tool.

Thank you to the testers, **Svenson** and **Aranos**!
